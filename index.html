      My name is Luke Hulsebus. I am a Korean American who has a love for technology that's almost as deep as my love of<br>
      video games haha! I've been using computers since the moment I could even understand what a computer was<br>
      computers are kind of a family tradition. My first experience with a computer was my dad's old home PC that he used to <br>
      let me play Flash games on. I played those games until my fingers hurt and I couldn't keep my eyes open! That love of<br>
      old Flash games led me to love a little indie game called, Minecraft. I was enthralled with that game for the longest<br>
      time. I made meaningful relationships, and strong friendships, and developed even stronger skills. You see, I wanted to <br>
      play this game with the friends I'd made, I wanted to so badly in fact, that I started to use the internet to see IF it<br>
      was even possible. It was.<br><br>
      
      I started to read and learn about servers, RAM, CPUs, and Cores! I had no idea what those things were at the time and I<br>
      didn't ever expect it to lead where I am today. I started to put together small pieces and I celebrated every time I got<br>
      something to work or found out something new about a piece I'd already made work. I made my first batch script, learned <br>
      what Java was, wrote my first cfg file, and even more. Months and months would go by, the friends I made were still here,<br>
      and we were still playing that same game we had grown up together on. Despite having a good system to play games with all<br>
      of them, I desired to learn more and to improve what we had. So I built my first computer, I booted my first computer from<br>
      the BIOS, I accessed my home router through a browser for the first time, I port forwarded for the first time, I wrote the<br>
      same cfg file and batch scripts I'd written time and time again. I made my first-ever home server.<br><br>
      
      And the rest from there was history. I joined the Robotics teams at my local middle school and then high school; I <br>
      started to learn about computer support and best practices; I learned (the hard way sometimes) about the importance of<br>
      cyber security and strong security protocols in general. Between all of this, I always found time for the people around me,<br>
      and for my other non-digital passions! I was in the Boy Scouts for 7 years; I participated in my high school drum line where<br>
      I played the bass drum; I played on a travel soccer team for 10 years; I boxed and practiced martial arts for 14 years; and I <br>
      tried every sport under the sun. But I always came back to my computer. Every night, after every major life event, after every<br>
      low point, I always came back to the game that started it all on the machine that made each time logging on so memorable. <br><br>
      
      After a long time of moving around, finding myself in people that I never dreamed I'd meet, learning skills I never thought<br>
      I'd use it again, I ended up back here again. At my computer, with the same old friends playing the same old game. And to be honest,<br>
      I hope I never stop.
